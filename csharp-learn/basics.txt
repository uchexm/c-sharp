Variables and Data Types in C#
In C#, variables are used to store data, and each variable has a specific data type that determines what kind of values it can hold.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Declaring and Initializing Variables
To declare a variable in C#, use the following syntax:


<data_type> <variable_name> = <value>;
Example:


int age = 25;
string name = "John";
If you don‚Äôt want to initialize immediately:


double price;  // Declaration
price = 99.99; // Assignment later
2Ô∏è‚É£ Common Data Types in C#
C# has several built-in data types, categorized as value types and reference types.

‚úÖ Value Types (Stored in Stack)
Value types store actual data, not references.

Data Type	Description	Example
int	Whole numbers	int x = 10;
double	Decimal numbers (64-bit)	double pi = 3.14;
float	Smaller decimal numbers (32-bit)	float price = 9.99f;
decimal	High precision decimal (for money)	decimal salary = 1000.50m;
char	Single character	char grade = 'A';
bool	Boolean (true/false)	bool isActive = true;
Example:


int count = 100;
float percentage = 75.5f;
bool isAvailable = true;
‚úÖ Reference Types (Stored in Heap)
Reference types store a reference (memory address) instead of actual data.

Data Type	Description	Example
string	Sequence of characters	string name = "Alice";
object	Base type of all data types	object obj = "Hello";
dynamic	Can hold any type (determined at runtime)	dynamic val = 5; val = "Now a string";
Example:


string message = "Hello, C#";
object data = 42;
dynamic flexible = 10.5;  // Can be changed later
3Ô∏è‚É£ var and dynamic (Flexible Types)
üîπ var (Compile-time Type Inference)
Type is inferred at compile time.
Cannot change type after assignment.

var number = 100;  // Treated as int
var text = "Hello"; // Treated as string
üîπ dynamic (Runtime Type Inference)
Type is determined at runtime.
Can change type after assignment.

dynamic anything = 50;
anything = "Now I'm a string!";
4Ô∏è‚É£ Nullable Types (?)
By default, value types cannot be null, but you can make them nullable:


int? age = null;
double? height = 180.5;
bool? isOnline = null;
5Ô∏è‚É£ Constants and Readonly Variables
const: Value must be assigned at declaration and cannot change.
readonly: Can be assigned in a constructor but not changed later.

const double Pi = 3.14159;
readonly int maxUsers;
6Ô∏è‚É£ Implicit and Explicit Type Conversion
üîπ Implicit Conversion (Safe)
C# automatically converts smaller types to larger types.


int num = 100;
double bigNum = num; // Implicit conversion (safe)
üîπ Explicit Conversion (Casting)
When converting a larger type to a smaller type, you need explicit casting.


double price = 99.99;
int wholePrice = (int) price; // Explicit casting
You can also use Convert:

string strNumber = "123";
int num = Convert.ToInt32(strNumber);
7Ô∏è‚É£ Example Code

Copy
Edit
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int age = 30;
        double salary = 5000.75;
        string name = "Alice";
        bool isEmployed = true;

        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Salary: ${salary}, Employed: {isEmployed}");
    }
}

Basic C# Syntax
Introduction
This summary explores the fundamentals of writing simple C# programs, focusing on core concepts such as syntax, variables, control structures, and methods. These elements form the foundation of all C# applications and are essential for writing functional, reusable code.

Program Structure
A C# program starts with a class definition and a Main method that serves as the program‚Äôs entry point. For example:

class Program

{

    static void Main(string[] args)

    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}

The Console.WriteLine() method outputs text to the console, illustrating basic syntax.

Variables and Data Types
Variables in C# hold data and are declared with specific types. Examples include:

int age = 25;
string name = "John";
var count = 10;

The var keyword allows for type inference, where the compiler determines the variable's type based on its assigned value.

Control Structures
Control structures manage the flow of a program:

If-Else Statements
Execute code based on conditions:

if (age >= 18) 
{
    Console.WriteLine("You're an adult.");
}
else 
{
    Console.WriteLine("You're a minor.");
}

Loops
Repeat actions, such as printing numbers:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}

Methods
Methods allow for reusable blocks of code. For example, an addition method can take two inputs and return their sum:

public static int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

Incorporating methods into classes organizes functionality and enhances code reusability.

Practical Example: Simple Calculator
A basic calculator program might look like this:

public class Calculator

{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int num1 = 5;
        int num2 = 10;
        int result = Add(num1, num2);
        Console.WriteLine("The sum is: " + result);
    }
    public static int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
}

This program sums two integers and prints the result to the console.

Handling User Input
C# can also handle user input via the Console.ReadLine() method. For example:

Console.WriteLine("Enter your name:");
string name = Console.ReadLine();
Console.WriteLine("Hello, " + name + "!");

This allows programs to interact with users dynamically.

Conclusion
You can build simple but effective C# programs, such as calculators and interactive user applications by mastering these core concepts- syntax, variables, control structures, and methods. These basics lay the groundwork for more advanced programming in C#.





for (int i =0; i <=15; ++i) {
    if (3 % i == 0 && 5 % i == 0){
        Console.WriteLine("FizzBuzz")
    }else if (3 % i == 0){
        Console.WriteLine("Fizz")
    }else if (5 % i == 0){
        Console.WriteLine("Buzz")
    }else{
        Console.WriteLine(i)
    }
}
